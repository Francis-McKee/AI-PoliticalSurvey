# AI-PoliticalSurvey
Machine Learning Political Party Survey JavaScript

An AI program that uses pattern-matching with training data in a survey to guess the user's political party.
This assignment was originally for the Artificial Intelligence class on study.com, and was required to be made with C++ as a CLI, however I wanted to modify it for use on the web in order to more useful and easily accessable, so I rewrote the program in JavaScript with a few modifications.
