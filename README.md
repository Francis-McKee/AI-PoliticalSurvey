# AI-PoliticalSurvey
Machine Learning Political Party Survey C++

A AI program that uses pattern-matching with training data in a survey to guess the user's political party.
This assignment was originally for the Artificial Integlligence class on study.com, and was required to be made with C++ (assignment code in 'C++' folder in repo), however I wanted to modify it for use on the web in order to more useful and easily accessable, so I rewrote the program in JavaScript with a few modifications.
